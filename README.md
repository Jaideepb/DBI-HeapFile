Implementing a Heap File
------------------------

This project involves implementing a Database, where you can create various databases and then add, store and delete records into and from the database. The implementation of DB is known as heap file which is an unordered file of records, where new records simply go at the end of the file. 

This is a part-1 of the series of implementations. Later implementations include variety of "flavors" of DBFiles like a sorted file and a B+-Tree file.

For more details of about the project description refer readme.txt and HeapImp.pdf.
